      <h3 style="font-family:cursive; text-align:left; color:goldenrod"> The hunger games is a novel that unfolds in Panem, an apocalyptic world. 
          The story is centered on a 16-year-old girl, Katniss Everdeen and her struggle 
          for survival in dystopia. Each year, as a punishment for the failed rebellion by District 13, 
          the 12 Panem Districts are forced to pay tribute to the ruthless Capitol regime. 
          The story begins on the day of reaping at District 12. A day that each district is 
          required to offer two tributes, a boy and a girl aged 12 to 18 years to participate in the games. 
          This was going to be the 74th hunger games. In a twist of fate, Prim Katniss’ 12-year-old sister 
          is selected as one of the tributes. Having lost their father at a young age, she isn’t going to 
          let her mother lose her too as she swore always to protect them. She volunteers to take her sister’s
           place, and together with the baker’s son, Peeta Mellark they represent district 12. What follows 
           is a series of events that will put Katniss in the spotlight both as a source of hope for the 
           oppressed and as an enemy of the Capitol. Her feelings for Peeta will be exploited for the games, 
           which are aired across all the districts. She will make new friends, enemies, inspire and give hope 
           to many people in Panem thanks to her performance in the games. What makes the hunger games a more 
           thrilling story is the games win or die rule. Will Katniss have the heart to kill Peeta and vice versa,
            or will they both survive? This is the Hunger Games summary of the plot. </h3>

        <h3 style="font-family:cursive; text-align:left; color:goldenrod"> Eventually they see Johanna Mason approaching with Wiress and Beetee. Johanna tells Katniss she saved them for her. Katniss realizes that the island is laid out like a clock face, with each section containing a different attack triggered at a set time, and she remembers Plutarch Heavensbee talking about his watch as he showed her the mockingjay. She realizes he was trying to tip her off about the arena. They all head to the Cornucopia, which contains weapons, and while they’re loading up a group of tributes sneaks up. One slits Wiress’s throat before Katniss kills him. Finnick saves Peeta in the fight.
                The group heads back into the jungle, and when Peeta wants to go collect water, Johanna won’t let him. Katniss realizes that the other tributes are trying to keep Peeta alive, but she doesn’t know why. Just then Katniss hears what sounds like her little sister screaming and rushes off to find it. It’s only a jabberjay, a bird the Capitol created that can mimic any sound it hears. Finnick hears one, too, that sounds like a woman named “Annie.” Katniss later learns that Annie is a victor from District 4 who went half-crazy surviving her Games. Finnick is in love with her. That night, Peeta tells Katniss she has to survive for the sake of her family, and he and Katniss spend the night together holding each other and kissing. The next morning, Beetee has a plan. At twelve noon and midnight each day, lightning strikes a tree on the island. By running a highly conductive wire Beetee has from the tree to the ocean, they can electrocute a large area of water and whatever sand is wet. He thinks the other remaining tributes would move to the beach if they left. If so, those tributes would be electrocuted.
                They hike to the tree and wrap the wire around it, and Katniss and Johanna begin carrying it back to the beach. Suddenly the wire is cut, and before Katniss knows what’s happening, Johanna hits her in the head and cuts something out of her arm. Katniss, still dizzy, thinks they’re trying to kill her and Peeta and heads back to the tree. She sees Beetee with the same arm wound holding a knife with the wire wrapped around it and realizes what he was trying to do. She wraps the wire around one of her arrows and fires it through a small, visible gap in the force field just as lightning strikes. The shock causes the force field to go down and knocks Katniss unconscious. She wakes to find a hovercraft retrieving her. On board are Haymitch, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, and they explain everything. Plutarch has for years been part of a secret rebel group, and many of the tributes were involved in a plot to bring down the force field around the island so they could escape. What they cut out of her arm was a tracking device. Several of the districts are now in a full-scale revolt, and their hovercraft is headed to District 13.
                Lastly, they tell Katniss they kept Peeta alive in the arena only because they knew she wouldn’t help them if he died. They need her because she’s the mockingjay, the symbol of the rebellion. But Peeta and Johanna couldn’t be rescued. They were taken by the Capitol. Katniss attacks Haymitch, feeling he used her and Peeta. She’s sedated, and when she comes to, Gale is there. He explains the Capitol started dropping bombs after the Games. He got her family out safely, but District 12 is gone.
